/**
 * KuduReadOptions holds configuration of reads to Kudu tables.
 *
 * @param batchSize Sets the maximum number of bytes returned by the scanner, on each batch.
 * @param scanLocality If true scan locality is enabled, so that the scan will
 *                     take place at the closest replica
 * @param faultTolerantScanner scanner type to be used. Fault tolerant if true,
 *                             otherwise, use non fault tolerant one
 * @param keepAlivePeriodMs The period at which to send keep-alive requests to the tablet
 *                          server to ensure that scanners do not time out
 * @param scanRequestTimeoutMs Maximum time allowed per scan request, in milliseconds
