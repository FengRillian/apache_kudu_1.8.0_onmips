/// @brief Representation of a Kudu client session.
///
/// A KuduSession belongs to a specific KuduClient, and represents a context in
/// which all read/write data access should take place. Within a session,
/// multiple operations may be accumulated and batched together for better
/// efficiency. Settings like timeouts, priorities, and trace IDs are also set
/// per session.
///
/// A KuduSession's main purpose is for grouping together multiple data-access
/// operations together into batches or transactions. It is important to note
/// the distinction between these two:
///
/// @li A batch is a set of operations which are grouped together in order to
///   amortize fixed costs such as RPC call overhead and round trip times.
///   A batch DOES NOT imply any ACID-like guarantees. Within a batch, some
///   operations may succeed while others fail, and concurrent readers may see
///   partial results. If the client crashes mid-batch, it is possible that
///   some of the operations will be made durable while others were lost.
/// @li In contrast, a transaction is a set of operations which are treated
///   as an indivisible semantic unit, per the usual definitions of database
///   transactions and isolation levels.
///
/// @note Kudu does not currently support transactions!  They are only mentioned
///   in the above documentation to clarify that batches are not transactional
///   and should only be used for efficiency.
///
/// KuduSession is separate from KuduTable because a given batch or transaction
/// may span multiple tables. This is particularly important in the future when
/// we add ACID support, but even in the context of batching, we may be able to
/// coalesce writes to different tables hosted on the same server into the same
/// RPC.
///
/// KuduSession is separate from KuduClient because, in a multi-threaded
/// application, different threads may need to concurrently execute
/// transactions. Similar to a JDBC "session", transaction boundaries will be
/// delineated on a per-session basis -- in between a "BeginTransaction" and
/// "Commit" call on a given session, all operations will be part of the same
/// transaction. Meanwhile another concurrent Session object can safely run
/// non-transactional work or other transactions without interfering.
///
/// Additionally, there is a guarantee that writes from different sessions
/// do not get batched together into the same RPCs -- this means that
/// latency-sensitive clients can run through the same KuduClient object
/// as throughput-oriented clients, perhaps by setting the latency-sensitive
/// session's timeouts low and priorities high. Without the separation
/// of batches, a latency-sensitive single-row insert might get batched along
/// with 10MB worth of inserts from the batch writer, thus delaying
/// the response significantly.
///
/// Though we currently do not have transactional support, users will be forced
/// to use a KuduSession to instantiate reads as well as writes. This will make
/// it more straight-forward to add RW transactions in the future without
/// significant modifications to the API.
