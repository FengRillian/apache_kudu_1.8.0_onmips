// A code cache is a specialized LRU cache with the following services:
//   1. It supports only one writer at a time, but multiple concurrent
//      readers.
//   2. If its items are taking too much space, it evicts the least-
//      recently-used member of the cache.
//
// The cache takes shared ownership of its entry values, the JITWrappers,
// by incrementing their reference count.
//
// LRU eviction does not guarantee that a JITWrapper is deleted, only that
// the cache releases its shared ownership (by decrementing the reference
// count) of the jit code.

  // TODO: currently CodeCache is implemented using the Cache in
  // kudu/util/cache.h, which requires some transformation to nongeneric
  // Slice-type keys and values. Furthermore, the Cache implementation
  // provides concurrent write guarantees (thus relies on locks heavily), which
  // is unnecessary for the CodeCache. A potential improvement would be to
  // implement a single-writer multi-reader LRU cache with proper generics.

  // TODO: a potential improvment would be for the cache to monitor its memory
  // consumption explicity and keep its usage under a size limit specified at
  // construction time. In order to do this, the cache would have to inject
  // a custom memory manager into the CodeGenerator's execution engine which
  // intercepts allocation calls and tracks code size.

  // Generates an empty code cache which stores at most 'capacity' JITWrappers.
  // A JIT payload is defined to be the combination of objects which rely on jitted
  // code and the classes which own the jitted code.
