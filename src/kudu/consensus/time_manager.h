// Manages timestamp assignment to consensus rounds and safe time advancement.
//
// Safe time corresponds to a timestamp before which all transactions have been applied to the
// tablet or are in-flight and is a monotonically increasing timestamp (see note at the end
// of this class comment).
//
// Snapshot scans can use WaitUntilSafe() to wait for a timestamp to be safe. After this method
// returns an OK status, all the transactions whose timestamps fall before the scan's timestamp
// will be either committed or in-flight. If the scanner additionally uses the MvccManager to wait
// until the given timestamp is clean, then the read will be repeatable.
//
// In leader mode the TimeManager is responsible for assigning timestamps to transactions
// and for moving the leader's safe time, which in turn may be sent to replicas on heartbeats
// moving their safe time. The leader's safe time moves with the clock unless there has been a
// transaction that was assigned a timestamp that is not yet known by the queue
// (i.e. AdvanceSafeTimeWithMessage() hasn't been called on the corresponding message).
// In this case the TimeManager returns the last known safe time.
//
// On non-leader mode this class tracks the safe time sent by the leader and updates waiters
// when it advances.
//
// This class's leadership status is meant to be in tune with the queue's as the queue
// is responsible for broadcasting safe time from a leader (and will eventually be responsible
// for calculating that leader's lease).
//
// See: docs/design-docs/repeatable-reads.md
//
// NOTE: Until leader leases are implemented the cluster's safe time can occasionally move back.
//       This does not mean, however, that the timestamp returned by GetSafeTime() can move back.
//       GetSafeTime will still return monotonically increasing timestamps, it's just
//       that, in certain corner cases, the timestamp returned by GetSafeTime() can't be trusted
//       to mean that all future messages will be assigned future timestamps.
//       This anomaly can cause non-repeatable reads in certain conditions.
//
// This class is thread safe.
