// Utility class to help place tablet replicas on tablet servers according
// to the location awareness policy. Currently, this class implements the logic
// specific to location awareness as described in [1], but it could enforce
// other placement policies in the future.
//
// In essence (for details see [1]), the location awareness placement policy
// is about:
//   * in case of N locations, N > 2, not placing the majority of replicas
//     in one location
//   * spreading replicas evenly among available locations
//   * within a location, spreading load evenly among tablet servers
//
// [1] https://s.apache.org/location-awareness-design
//
// TODO(aserbin): add a link to the doc once it appears in the upstream repo.
//
// NOTE: in the implementation of this class, it's OK to use an empty string
// in place of boost::none for a location because valid location strings begin
// with '/' and therefore are nonempty.
