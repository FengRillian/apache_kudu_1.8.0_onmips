= How to run Apache RAT on a release tarball

Kudu has a script and an excludes file to allow for running RAT on a release
artifact. You can use the following steps to verify a source tarball.

1. Download a binary artifact of RAT:
   `wget http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/rat/apache-rat/0.11/apache-rat-0.11.jar`
2. Run RAT:
   `java -jar apache-rat-0.11.jar -x apache-kudu-X.Y.Z.tar.gz > rat-report.xml`
3. Run the report checker:
   `./build-support/release/check-rat-report.py build-support/release/rat_exclude_files.txt rat-report.xml`

The above steps are automatically performed as part of the `build-support/build_source_release.py` script.
