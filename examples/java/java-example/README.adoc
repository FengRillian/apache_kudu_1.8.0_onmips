= Kudu Java client example README
:author: Kudu Team
:homepage: https://kudu.apache.org/

This is an example program that uses the synchronous Kudu Java client APIs to

- Create a table
- Insert some rows
- Alter the table
- Scan some rows
- Delete the table

To build and run, ensure maven is installed and from the java-example directory run:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/kudu-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

By default, the example assumes the Kudu cluster has a single master running on
localhost with the default port 7051. To specify a different set of masters for
Kudu cluster, set the property `kuduMasters` to a CSV of the master addresses in
the form `host:port`, as shown:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -DkuduMasters=master-0:7051,master-1:7051,master-2:7051 -jar target/kudu-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
