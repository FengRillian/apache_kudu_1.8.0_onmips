= Kudu Python client Graphite example
:author: Kudu Team
:homepage: https://kudu.apache.org/

This uses the Python client to implement a plugin for using graphite-web with
Kudu as a backend. Be aware it's meant just as an example of how to use the
Python client. It is not a well-tested integration.
