# This script serves to workaround a problematic OpenSSL ABI change
# made between RHEL 6.4 and 6.5. Namely:
#
#  RHEL 6.4's OpenSSL library is built with no symbol versioning. For example:
#  $ objdump -T libssl.so | grep SSL_CTX_new
#    0000000000037110 g    DF .text  0000000000000577  Base        SSL_CTX_new
#
#  RHEL 6.5's OpenSSL library has symbol versions. For example:
#  $ objdump -T /usr/lib64/libssl.so | grep SSL_CTX_new
#    0000003ae8243610 g    DF .text  0000000000000597  libssl.so.10 SSL_CTX_new
#
# Thus, if we build Kudu on RHEL 6.5 or later, the resulting binaries expect
# the versioned symbols in libssl and will not run on RHEL 6.4 or earlier:
#
#  $ objdump -T kudu-tserver | grep SSL_CTX_new
#    0000000000000000      DF *UND*     0000000000000000  libssl.so.10 SSL_CTX_new
#
# In contrast, if a binary is built not expecting versioned symbols, the runtime
# linker can still resolve those symbols by choosing the versioned ones. Thus,
# binaries built against RHEL 6.4 are forward-compatible to later versions, but
# not vice versa.
#
# Note that Kudu cannot simply be built on RHEL 6.4 because the devtoolset toolchain is
# not available. So, given that we want to produce binaries that run on RHEL 6.4,
# we need to perform a workaround such that our binaries built on 6.6 don't depend
# on the versioned symbols in OpenSSL. This script provides such a workaround.
#
# The workaround itself is quite simple: we download the OpenSSL RPMs from CentOS 6.4
# and unpack them into a directory in thirdparty/. If we then build against those
# the resulting binaries can run on either el6.4 or el6.6.
